  descriptionOfRoom: You enter a room whose only source of light is a small lamp.
    The lamp is mounted on the wall. On the ceiling you notice something that resembles
    a fire sprinkler system. On the north wall you see the words "WELCOM TO MY GAS
    CHAMBER" written in red paint.  You are horrified. On the east wall you see a
    door which is locked with a rusty chain and a pad lock and on the west wall you
    see a brand new keyhole.
